## understanding the scalability and HA 

scalability is differnt from the HA 
how ?

meaning that an application or system can handle greater loads by adapting resources 
there are 2 kinds namely: 
    Veritcal scalability
    Horizontal scalability(=elasticity)
scalability is linked but differnt to High Availablity

 Veritcal scalability -
 to increase the sizse of the instances -- scaled into jr to Sr to get lodas 

 t2.micro into .large 

 is very common for non distrubited sytesm like dabase , RDS , Elastic cahce


 Hrztl scalabiltiy 
 number of instnaces or systems for ur 
 ie hiring more employues of same role to tke up loads 


----HA------------------

usualy gos hand in hand with horizontal scaling 

HA means running your apllication sytem in at lesat 2 data center (== AZ)
high avaiablity is to survie a data center loss 

HA  can be passive 

Veritcal scaling === (=scale up / down )
from t2.nano 0.5 G of ram , 1 vCPU

Hrzizontal scaling increase number of instaces (= scale out // in )
auto scaling group 
load balancer multi AZ
