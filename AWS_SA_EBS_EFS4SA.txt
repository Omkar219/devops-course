### 
EBS volume can be attached to only one instance at time 
locked and can be moved only by snapshot via 
recreating it into differnt AZ 
## EBS backups use IO and you shouldn't run them while at peak traffic
root EBS volume of instaces get terminated by default if the ec2 instances are terminated.(BUT CAN BE DISABLED)


\\DISK IO is high => increase EBS volume size(forGp2)
\\EFS mounting 100s of instances
\\EFS share website files 
\\ EBS gp2 , optimize on cost 
\\Custom AMi for faster deploy on ASG 
\\ EFS vs EBS vs Instance store
