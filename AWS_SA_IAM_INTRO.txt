IAM, EC2, S3 

AWS region and AZs?

regions are all around the world.
each region will have the availability zone
with 3 azs that are isolated.

AWS region concept doesn't apply for services like - IAM & S3 , which is global service.

IAM = identity and access management
    AWS security is there for Users,Groups,Roles.

    Root account should never be changed (and shared)
    users must be created with proper permissions , IAM is at the center of AWS ,
    Polices are written in JSON - JavaScript Object Notation
    users-physical persona
    groups - functions&teams&contains users 
    Roles- for AWS Resources - Machines 
    all these are documented on JSOn 

    IAM has a global view , this will be avaliable for all the region has its global
    MFA - multi factor, Persmissions are goverend by JSON
    minimal amount of permissions they need to perform their JOB .
    IAM - users and roles !! don't use it on credentials 
    ROOT account ! Root IAM credentials
