## RDS -- 
RDS -- Relational Database serive
managed DB service for DB user SQL as a Query language 
create db in the cloud that are managed by aws
potsgres,oracle,mysql,mariaDB,SQLserver,Aurora - AWS -proprity db

managedsericve,os patching level, conin.. bkup and restore timestap, monitoring dashboard 
read replicas for improved read performance,
multi AZ stup for DR , maintenance windows for upgrades 
scaling capability 
--- you cant ssh into your instances !! 

how it works ?
Read replicas for read scalability
    upto 5 read replicas within AZ , cross AZ or Cross Region!
    replication is ASYNC so reads are eventually cosistent 
    replicas can be promoted to their own DB 
\\  applications must be updated the connection string to leverage read replicas !! 
    applications -- RDS instance read replica (R)- aysnc replications -rds db (W.R) --- a sync replicationsRDS (R)


RDS multie instances -- multi AZ - Disaser recovery -- for different AZ !
SYNC replication -- standyby mode -- 
one dns name automatic app failover to standby in case of failover ! 
failover in case of loss of AZ loss of network instance or storage failure
no manual intervention in apps ! 



RDS backup -- automated backups enabeld in RDS 

automated backups ! 
daily full snapshot of the Database capture transtin logs in real time 
-> abilty to restore to any point in time -- 7 days retention ! to 35 days 

DB snapshots -- mauntal trigerd by the uer retenion of backup for as long as u wan t 

RDS encryption ! 
-- rest capabilty with AWS KMS -AES 256 encryptionSSL certion
to enfore SSL encrypt data 
postgreSQL : rds.force_ssl=1
MYsQL withind backup
grad usage on to Require SSL
to connect using SSl -- Trust certificate - download AWS 
SSL options when connecting to DB \\\\

RDS security !
rDS db are usually deployued within a private subnet not in a public one
RDS security works by lvrgin security groups !! it controls who can communicate with RDS 
IAM polices help


### HANDson ## 
RDS -> aurora -- mysql compatirable -- free tire mysql ! postgreSQl !! free uasage ! 
GPL model instnace as storage 
storage type -- allocated storage 20 GIB , DB instance identr - my1stsql
masterussrn --

Encryyption -- KMS console tool will be encryption !1

SLELECTRON -- download GUI !!  
myrds dabat base serer 3307 -- connect !! endpoint -url -port 


-----------RDS security for sysops
Encryption at rest -- done onl when you 1st create the DB instance -- EBS volumes -snapshot --snapshot encrypted - create DB 

check ports/iop / SG inbound rules in DB Sg 
in databse user creation and permissions
creating a databse with or without public accessensure paramter groups or DB is confgured to only allow sssl conections
AWS responsbility ---- no ssh,no db pactching,no os pacthcing ,no way to autid the underlying instances !! 
RDS is a managed system !!
