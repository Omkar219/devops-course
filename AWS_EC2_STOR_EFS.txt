## EBS volume ???
EC2 root volume ( main volume ) will its volume when its terminated manually 

way to store instance data can be stored in EBS - block store 
its network drive drive --- detached from an ec2 instance and attached to another one quickly

Its loaded to an AZ
FOR EXample EBS can be attched to south-india-1 to atcched to south-india-2
To move the volume across make sure that you take a snapshot for safer side and best practices,
provisioned capacity size in GBs and IOPS can be billed for all the provisioned capacity.
(if you use one gb among 1 TB , you still will be billed on 1tb not on 1gb)

there are 4 types of EBS volumes:

GP2 - SSD - gnrl purpose ssd - balances price & performance for a wide variety of workloads 
IOI - SSD - highest performance for missions crictical low latency / high workloads
STI - HDD - low cost - frequently used - high or more workloads
SCI - HDD - low cost - less frequently used accessed by workloads 


EBS characters = size | throughput | IOPS ( i/o ops per sec)
only GP2 and IOI used for booting volumes ! becz they're faster in loading ! 

############ hands on ####################

Ec2 

create new instances - ami - loinux 2 --- default next - 
STORAGE --->> 8 gp2 volume ssd2 -- delete on termiantion 
EBS --->> /dev/sdb/--- 2 SSD gp2 -- not encrypt -- don't delete on termination.
name --- ebs demo -- secuirgy gorup -- ssh 22 keypair- tutorial.pem 

block device -- /dev/sdb//
volumes --- EBSdemo -- 2 Gb they have same on AZs 
ssh into it 
inside linux terminal -- lsblk

use formating for sdb file going through mk2fs commands

type use cases 

GP2???
used for development, low ltncy, bootvolumes,
1gig -16TB, small gp2 volumes can burst IOPS to 3000, max 16,000
3 IOPS per GB means at 5443 GB we are at the max IOPS 
3IOPS = 1 Gb 

## IO1 ???

IOPS perfromace , more than 16000 IOPS per volume gp2 limit
large DBs , workloads - like SQL server , MongoDB , Cassandra , PostgreSQL , Oracle .
4gb-16TB , IOPS - min 100 and max 64,000 -- else max 32,000 for ohter instances 
maximum ratio of provisioned IOPS to requested volume size(in GiB) is 50:1 

### st1 ?

fast througput at low price - big data , data warehouses ,;log , apache kafka
500Gib -16 TB , maxIOPs is  500, Max throughput of 500mibs can burst 

### SC1 -- lowedst storaget cost -- 250 can burst -- cheaper and best for low budget !
