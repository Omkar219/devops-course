#### Quick recap on load balancers ### 
classsic load balancers - questions on security groups , stickness 
applicaiotn lb -- osi layer 7 - routing basedonhostname --- .com
---------- paths .. redirect 00 http to https 
---- dynamic host port mappong with esc
----- DNS 

NLB -- layer 4 osu gets static IP per AZ :
publick facing must attach elastic Ip can help whitelist by clietns 
--------- elastic Ip 
--- random pvip on facing 
--- has corss zone balancign 
---- SSL termination Jan 2019 

LB SG 

--- http tcp 80
--- https tcp 443 https 
applkication security group --- source - security group only load balancer talks to ec2

ssl ceritficates -- encrypted over www -- lb --- http over private vps
load balncesuses an x.509 certifcates **ssl /tls 
ACM -- AWS cerrtifacte manger
upload ur own cerrtificates alternatively
--- HTTPS listener 
 must specify a default certificates 
 can add an optional list of certs to support ,multipel domains 
 clients can use SNI -- server name indeication -- to specify the hostname they reach 
 older ssl/tls - leagcy 

 ################# Auto Scaling groups ##############

load on your webistes and application can change 
in the clud you can create and get rid of servers very quickly 

goal of an auto scarlign group - ASG is to 
scale out / scale in --- to match increased load and to match decreased load.
Ensure we have a minimum and a maximum number of machines running 
\\\\ automatically register new instaces to a LD 
minimum-desired--madxmkin

ASG with loadblancer

scaling polices 

Auto scalring arlames 
--- using cloud watch alarms --- triggers EC2 
New rule --- better auto scarling target average CPU 
ELB reqest . netwk in and out .
easier to setup and can make more sense 

custom metric -- send custom emter ec2 to cloudwatch using applicaiotn\
create cloud watch alarm to react to  low / high values 
create cloud watch alarm as the scarling policy for ASG

IAM roles atttached to an asg  to ec2 instace
ASG is free -- underlyingresources being launched 

ASG means that if they get terminated for wtter ASG will restart tehem ..
ASG will terminate instances marked as unhealthy by an LB -- Hence replace scale
