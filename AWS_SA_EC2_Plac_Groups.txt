### PlacementGroups 
sometimes you want control over the ec2 instance Placement stratgey

stratgey can be used using placement greoups 

cluster - clusters instancezss into a low latency group in a single AZ
spread - spreads instances across underlying HW(max 7 instances per group per AZ )- critcial applications
partitions - Spreads instances across many different partitions(RELy on diff sets of racks )within an AZ,
scales to 100s of EC2 instances per group like (ELK,Haddoop,Cassandra,Kafka)


pros 
each othe giving you high performance computing and network 
placement group clouster low latency - 10 GBPS network
great network
cons- rack fails , all instaces fails at the smae time 
use case big data job that needs complet efast
apl that needs extrmely low latency and hight netowkrthroughput


spread --- will allocation will be on dfiferent HW --

pros - can span across availbility AZ
reduced risk is simultaneous failure
ECU instances are on different Physical hardware

cons - limited to 7 instaces per AZ per placement group 

that needs max HA, each instancesmust be isolated
--------

partitions --- 
set of racks 
us - east 1a -- differnt partions will have number of EC2 instaces with can be of p1 , p2 , p3 - 7
supproits upto 7 partiion per AZ
100s of ec2 instances 
the instaces in a partition do not share racks with the instances in the other partitions 
a partition failure can affect manyu ec2 but wont affect other partitions 
ec2 instaces get acces to the poartitions information as metadata
