### EBS snapshot

incremental - only backup changed blocks 
EBS backup use IO and you shouldn't run them while your application is handling a lot of traffic 
snapshot stored in s3 !! (wot see them)
max 100,000 snashop copy accross az or geion.
can make image - ami from snapshot 
EBS volume s restored by snapshots need to be pre-warmed -- using fio or dd command to read the entire volume.
snapshots can be automated using Amazon Data Lifecyle Manager 


EBS -- Data lifeCycle manager -- create time schedular for taking out snapshots ! 
automated backup options --- sysOPS ! 

EBS migration -- 
EBS volumes are only locked to a specific az
to migrate to differnet on AZ
snapshot the volume -> copy the volume move it to differnt region -> create volume from the snapshot inthe AZ of your choice ! 

EBS encryption runs on KMS - AES-256 enabling encryption ! 

HON ---
usin copy !! -- copy and encrypt -- region -- master key ! 
kms key id == create a volume from -- it will be encrypted ! 


######### important ##### 
EBS VS instance store ! 
some instance do not come with root EBS volumes 
! 
instead , they come with instance store == ephermeral storage ! 

instance store is phyiscally attache d to the machine - EBS is a netowrk drive 

PROS --- IO / cahce/ data / tempory content / data surive reboot /
cons -- on stop termination - instance store is lost ! you cant resize the instance store ! backups must be operated by the user.


EBS - RAID configuration !! 
RAID LOL ! 
EBS redundant storage !
increase IOPS - 100 000 IOPs 

RAID is possible as long as your spports it ! 
RAID - 0 , 1 --- not using 5 and  6 
Riad 0 increase perfromance 
ec2 - one logical volume - ebs v1 ebs v2 ! 
combining2 or more volumes getting the total disk spcace and IObut one disk fails all the data is failed !!!
risking more , use case would be --doesn't need fault -tolerance ! databse that has replication already built in 

ex-- 500 GIb amazon bs IO 1 volumes with 40000 ,createa 1000 Gb raid 0 array with bandwith of 8000IOPS with 1,000MBS throughput
---------

############## RAID 1 
RAID 1  = mirroring a volume to another  !! 
if one disk fails our logical volume is still wroking !! 
we have to send the datga to two EBS volume at sme time (2x Network)
