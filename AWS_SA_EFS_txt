HA , scalable , expensive (3xgp2)

webserving , wordpress,
NFSv4.1 protoc. SG to control acces to EFS 
linx based MAI - Widnows

performance mode--- GP(default) max IO - used when thousands of EC2 are using the EFS 
EFS file sync to sync from on premise file system to EFS !
backup EFS to EFS -- incremental can choose frequency ! 
encryption at rest using KMS !!!!!!!!

EFS - HANDSon 
create security Groups ! --- SG to EFS ! 
inbound no rules -- outbound all rules !

create file sytel - configure file system access !!
we have 3 AZ avalible on all other ! assign Sg -- EFSdmo secuiry grup

bursting 
provisoed 
enable encryption 
with KMS 
review and create - and store -- there will be creating stage -- file system ID copy , mem sized ! 


HON---

create EFs file system copy the system id ! and create new ec2 instance - edit and launch give them EFS SG groups created rencetly
so it could be accessed ! 
SSH to server - instal yum amazon efs utils and mount it by using systemid 

inbount rule to EC2 instance -- create security group 
+ NFS tcp - with port 2049 ,, source will be ec2 to efs Security gorup for all the ports ! (EC2 will be allowed )
