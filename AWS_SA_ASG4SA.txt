## recap on ASG ##
2 az zones some are v1 v2 and v1 on another zones
ASG default termination policy -- simplified version ---
find most instacnes on az - so az-A 
oldest one will be deleted from the termination
ASG tries the balance he number of instnces across az 

ASG for soltions architects 

scaling cool downs -- metrics to go down... 
terminates before the other effects takes place ...
simple scaling policy 
scarling specific cooldown period overrides thedefault cooldown period 
common use for scarling specific crietr or metric policy terminates instaces Ec2 auto scarling needs 


default cool down is 300 seconds -- you can reduce costgs by applying a scaling specific cool down period
of 180 seconds to the scale in policy -- 

application is scaling up and down multiple times eaach hour , modify auto scarling grps cool down 
timers and the cloud watch alarm period that triggers that scale in .
