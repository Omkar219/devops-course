Aurora - AWS 
properity tech fro mAWS 0-no open  source

postgtre and mysql are boht supported as aurora DB -- drivers will work as if aurora was a postrgre or msql 

"aws cloud optimised" 5x performace over mysql rds , 3 x over postgre 

auror storage automatically gros in increments of 10gb to 64 TB 

can have 15 replicas , mysql has 5 -- faster than 10 ms 
failover in auror in instnace its HA native



Aurora HA and Read scaling 
6 copies of your data acrsos 3 AZ
4 copies out of 6 needed for writes 
3 copuies out of 6 need for reads
self healing pertoper replciations 
storage is striped across 100s of voluumes 

instakes wtakes writes (master)
automated failover for master in less than 30 seconds
master is only 1 
and upto 15 aurora read repklicas rserver reads ,
supports cross regions ! 

aurora DB cluster ! 
Shared storage volumes 
writer endpoint -- pointing to the master ! -= MASTEr 

autoscaling of 1 to 15 replicaes on the read ! 
reader endping with connection load bakancing !  
connection level --- 

feature -- failover , BR , isolation , industry comparing
pushbotton scaling,
auto matchin g wiht zero downtine
advanced monitoring
routine maintenance 
backstrrack - restore data at any point of time without using backups ! 

Auroar securityu - encrypiton at rest using KMs 

automated backups snapshots and replicas are also encrpyuted 
SSL , using IAM , for protecting the instance with security groups ! can;t SSH !!!

Aurora serverless 
no need to choose an instance size ! only supports mysql 5.6 postgree
helpful when you cant predict the workload 
DB sluster starts , shutdown scales automaticlly based on cpu / connectioncan migrate from aurora cluster to auror
