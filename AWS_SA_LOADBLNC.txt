#### load balancing ?
\
load blanace forward internet traffic to multiple servers ec2 instances downstream

internet- load blanacer - ec-1,ec-2,ec-3 distrubled traffic..
Single point of access DNS to your application 
seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances
do regular health checks to your instances 
provide SSL terminations HTTPS for your websites 
enforece stickiness with cookies 
HA across zones 
separate public traffic from private traffic

why to use an ec2 load balancer ?/

ELB - elastic load balancer is a manged load balancer 
--- guarantes that it will be workig 
--- takes care of upgrades maintenace ,HA 
few configurations knobs 
costs setup load balancer it will be a lot more effort to create our own , so we tend to use ELB 
integrated with many AWS ofering / Services

 3 kind load balancer 

 classic load balancer -20089
 application load blr - 2016
 network LB - v2 new generation 2017
 overall it is recommende to use the new /v2 genration load balancers as they provide features 
 setup internal priate - external public 

 health checks - crucial LD blrs 
 they enable the load balance to know if instances it forwaards traffic to avalible 
 rsponse not 200 OK , then the instance is unhealthy


 ----- Application load balancer v2 
 --- is layer7 
 LB - multiple http applications across macheins ( can also target groups )
 LB - multiple applications on the same maches( docker containers / containers )
 lB - route / hostname in url
 - micro/containres
 - port mapping feature to redirect to a dynamice port 
 - Classic load balancer 

 HTTPD based traffic - external applciation loadblancer v2 -- http
 wwww-- LB --HTTP ---target group users --
                    target group search ec2,ec2,---healthcheck

stickness can be enabled - this can be enalbed by avalible
ALB supprots http/https / websockets portcosl
--- application servers dont see the IP of the client directly 
--- true ip of the client is inserted in the header of X-FORWARD-FOR 
--- we can aslo get portX-FORWARDED-PORT)and porto (X-FORWARDED-PORTO)

eg 
        CLIENT IP -> ALB -> PRIVATE IP >- EC2 

------ Network load balancer v2 
--- layer4
--- forward tcp traffic to instance 
--- handle millions of request per seconds 
--- support static / elastic IP
--- less latency - 100 ms 

NLB - mostly used for extreme performacnce and should not be the default load balancr you choose
over all creation process is the same as the application load balancers 


load balancer
good to know 
--- ALB -- http / ttps webspckat
--- NLB -- tcp traffic 
CLB / ALB support SSl certificoates and provide ssl termination
ALL load blance have health check capability 
ALB can route on based on hostname/Ip 
ALB is great fit with ECS (Docker)

--- Any CLB.ALB.NLB -static hostname , dont resolve and use underlying Ip
--- LBS can scale but not instnatily -- cotnact aws for a warm-up
--- NLB directly see the client Ip 
--- 4xx errors are client induced errors 
--- 5xx erros are applciation induced errors 
------ load balancer errors 503 means at capacity or no registered serer/target 
------ LB cant connect to your application check your secuirty groups ..

---- ALB & NLB others are deprecated !
